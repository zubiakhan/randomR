                    <p>1) &nbsp;Most levels will require some amount of lateral thinking combined with some help from our good ol' friend Google :). <br><br>

                        2) &nbsp; Answers are not case sensitive. In case the answer contains more than one word, do not forget to include spaces. <br><br>

                        3)&nbsp;We have observed, based on experiences from the previous versions of Klueless, that in spite of getting the right answers, players refuse to enter them and try them out! We have no restrictions on the number of attempts, so do abuse this rule outrightly<br><br>

                        4) &nbsp;As the difficulty levels increase, so does our reluctance to give out obvious clues. In case we find many players to be stuck at certain levels, a blatant push will be provided from our end. But the later levels of the game are made in such a way that players will have to spend some time wrapping their head around the clues, rather than expect the same to be solved in a matter of minutes.<br><br>

                        5)&nbsp;Clues will be provided only on the official blog (link at the top of every level) and not on the Facebook page<br><br>

                        6)&nbsp;In case there is a lag between your post on the blog/e-mail and us replying, it's not because we don't like your screen name or might have met you in real-life and disliked your personality. It is simply because The sheer number of comments that need to be moderated makes it impossible to give an immediate response<br><br>


                        7)&nbsp;Please do not share the answers on personal blogs/websites or other forums. It is quite possible that the other person may finish before you<br><br>
